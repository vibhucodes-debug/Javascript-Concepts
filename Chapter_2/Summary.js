Summary
JavaScript has a different variable declaration technique than most programming 
languages. var declares the variable within the function scope, let declares the variable 
in the block scope, and variables can be declared without any operator in the global 
scope; however, global scope should be avoided at all times. For type checking, typeof 
should be used to validate the expected type. Finally, for equality checks, use == to check 
the value, and use === to check for the type as well as the value. However, use these only 
on non-object types such as numbers, strings, and booleans.
